    <h1>Conferencing</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my conference... doc!</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Science - First period</h2>
        <p>Some of my favorite topics that I have learned in science is that Mrs. VH has taught me about how seasons work on Earth. The most interesting thing about it is that Earth has a tilt. The reason this happened is because an object the size of Mars hit Earth; the object was named after "Theia."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Social Studies - Second period</h2>
        <p>Something that was interesting in Social Studies is that we always watch videos. They make us take notes, and that I have done all of it every single time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Language Arts - Third period</h2>
        <p>Most recently, I've read some of Challenger Deep, and I have failed on the exit tickets. I have read the questions, and understood what it was asking me. So I will be prepared next time!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>STEAM - Fourth period</h2>
        <p>STEAM, which stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics, provides many materials I can use to create things, such as mousetrap cars. However, this project resulted in some people getting hurt and ending up in the health room. It's an overall great class.</p>
    </div>

     <div class="section">
        <h2>Math - Fifth period</h2>
        <p>In this class, I do simple or hard math. I forgot what project I was doing in there, but I think it's about geometry and measuring the sides of things. I haven't worked hard in this class.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>PE - Sixth period</h2>
        <p>When It comes to sixth period, I exercise in the weight lifting room (or whatever you call it). I am NOT interested in pickle ball, nor badminton. There is not a whole lot to talk about in this class.</p>
    </div>

        <h2>Thought's that I have</h2>
        <p>There's not really anything to say, although Iâ€™m kind of disappointed with how this school has wronged me multiple times.</p>
    </div>

     <div class="section">
        <h2>My grades</h2>
        <p>They have consequently gotten a little bit better because of my ban on 12/12/24 (hey nice date). The change wasn't that big though.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Ending</h2>
        <p>Thanks for reading! I hope this was enough information.</p>
