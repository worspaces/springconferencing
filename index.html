    <h1>Conferencing</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my conference... doc!</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Science - First period</h2>
        <p>Some of my favorite topics that I have learned in science is that Mrs. VH has taught me about how seasons work on Earth. The most interesting thing about it is that Earth has a tilt. The reason this happened is because an object the size of Mars hit Earth; the object was named after "Theia."</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Social Studies - Second period</h2>
        <p>Something that was interesting in Social Studies is that we always watch videos. They make us take notes, and that I have done all of it every single time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Language Arts - Third period</h2>
        <p>Most recently, I've read some of Challenger Deep, and I have failed on the exit tickets. I have read the questions, and understood what it was asking me. So I will be prepared next time!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>STEAM - Fourth period</h2>
        <p>STEAM, which stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics, provides many materials I can use to create things, such as mousetrap cars. However, this project resulted in some people getting hurt and ending up in the health room. It's an overall great class.</p>
