    <h1>Conferencing</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my conference... doc!</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Science - First period</h2>
        <p>Some of my favorite topics that I have learned in science is that Mrs. VH has taught me about how seasons work on Earth. The most interesting thing about it is that Earth has a tilt. The reason this happened is because an object the size of Mars hit Earth; the object was named after "Theia."</p>

        <h2>Social Studies - Second period</h2>
        <p>Something that was interesting in Social Studies is that we always watch videos. They make us take notes, and that I have done all of it every single time.</p>
